 Heartbreaking to see all the people who commented they haven‚Äôt made friends at uni. I‚Äôve been blessed to meet the most lovely brilliant people this year and had an old friend transfer to Beckett. Last year  I wasn‚Äôt so lucky. If anyone wants to join for a board game night  you are honestly welcome. This is a genuine invitation. Just comment and I‚Äôll message. I‚Äôve commented on previous posts with my friends Neve and NS so you can message me directly.  Loneliness is one of the most horrible and deeply unnecessary feelings. Reach out if you see someone struggling.

 Going places on your own is underrated.  Go for food by yourself. Go shopping by yourself. Go to concerts by yourself. Go to the cinema by yourself. Go for walks by yourself.   It s so important to learn how to do stuff on your own  and I don t think enough people at uni realise that.

 In reply to #LeedsFess16281 I also believe CV is haunted - I shit you not - a few months ago we got a random knock on the door and there was some random girl crying stood on the other side that we didn‚Äôt know. Obvs didn‚Äôt answer it because it was fucking creepy. She then slowly made her way round all the other doors on the floor knocking and no-one answered  probably either not in or thinking the same thing as us. Next minute she‚Äôs disappeared with no sound of the lift and I didn‚Äôt even hear the stairs door go. Only a few mins later the power went off in Central Village. Never used to believe in all of that stuff but I kid you not there‚Äôs something creepy going on.

 Bit of a long/more serious one but i need some advice so here goes. i m really not enjoying my time at uni - i don t think this is the uni or city for me and i m really miserable here. i don t feel happy with the few friends that i ve made and whenever i see all my home friends in other cities i get so jealous that they re enjoying their experience. my parents are telling me to stick it out because i m in second year  but i don t want to look back on my uni experience as having  stuck it out  and got it over with  i want to be enjoying my time here. i would transfer to another uni but my main concern is that i m just now about to finish second year  so even if i went to another uni and re sat second year there wouldn t everyone have already settled in and made friends? i ve also already signed onto my house for third year so i feel like i m roped into seeing it through  even though the thought of having to live there with my housemates and stay here for another year makes me completely dread next year. i m worried this is a case of  the grass is always greener  and that if i were to move uni i d regret it and be just as miserable somewhere else. does anyone please have any advice or have any experience with starting at a new uni in second year? i feel so lost  miserable  and find myself wishing i d gone to a different uni on the daily...

 The ultimate guide of knowing how and when to get a seat in libraries during exam period: 1. Eddy B The most popular/busy library by FAR. So i ll be very clear and direct with you - you WILL NOT get a seat in eddy B worth your time past 9am  your chances are pretty low already by 8.45  trust. People in eddy B are a whole new level  who cares about rules  people arrive at 8am  save a seat  leave and don t come back till they can be asked. So once you ve missed the morning slot it s a bye bye till about 7pm when you re bound to get a seat when people fuck off back home for dinner.   For weekend -  don t trust the librarians  they re SNEAKY LITTLE SNAKES. According to minerva opening hour: 10am - ignore that. They actually let people in at 9.45am. Its like bloody wimbledon outside eddy B on the weekends so you better have your camping gear.  2. Brotherton All the clever people are starting to come here as they are realising that eddy b isn t all unicorns and rainbows. But beware  brotherton  although it is more civilised  it s full at peak times as well. It is essential to be there within first 1hr 30min of opening to get a seat  and if you arrive mid morning 0r mid afternoon  the only place you ll get a seat is in the dreaded deep dark depths of floor 1  where it is rather peaceful (once you learn to ignore the creaks and potential stomping of people above). On the weekend  these losers are queuing outside as well so be there with camping gear for round 2  and be prepared to be kicked out by loudspeaker at 4.15pm.  3. Laidlaw A big fat DITCH - absolutely not worth you re time unless you re nocturnal and work at 4am which just isn t productive anyway.. Its design is a waste of space and can fit approx...no students.  4. Health sciences  You might think you ve found the one library which won t be busy  because no one actually knows where it is let alone how to get it... But i assure you  it s being used alright. It s full of all the keen scientists and medical students and - they don t take breaks so gd luck trying to poach seats.  Sincerely from someone who has learnt the art of the library.

 Nothing worse when people say things like  you have to be autistically intelligent to do xyz . Autism is where your brain works differently to other people s and you have difficulty communicating etc  it has nothing to do with intelligence and in fact autistic people can often find it more difficult to understand things. Educate yourselves and stop being so ignorant
 Part 3 of Cv ghost stories  Right I need my fellow STEM students to explain the mechanics of this situation bc I‚Äôm shook.  Multiple times this year things have been falling off my shelves after being left alone for hours/ days and when I‚Äôm on the other side of the room. We are talking projectile motion people! The worst I had was when my makeup tub was thrown off my shelf along with some vitamins. I tell you the aftermath was a mess. I was originally near my bathroom and so had no part in this process.   Try and convince me that that isn‚Äôt a ghost!

 Part 2 of Cv ghost stories  Now for my haunting story. Ya gal was an idiot and left her phone locked in her room when I went to the library but fear not  I hadn‚Äôt forgotten my laptop or earphones.   So there I was  blasting Lizzo through my earphones while getting on with my mechanics revision when mid song it changed. Without me touching my laptop  I‚Äôd gone from bopping to Lizzo to listening to ‚Äòput your head on my shoulder‚Äô by Paul Anka from the 50‚Äôs. Now I was FREAKING out. The only other way you could access my Spotify account was by my phone which was locked in my room and my hands were no where near my laptop. So I can confirm  cv‚Äôs ghost loves 1950‚Äôs songs.

 Is anyone else experiencing paranormal activity in Central village??  Part 1 of Cv ghost stories:  Okay  so it all started when my flatmate  E  went to knock on I‚Äôs door. Music was coming from inside her room and so E kept knocking. Suddenly the music stopped but no one came to the door. She was obviously confused so she messaged I to see if she was in. She wasn‚Äôt. No one was in the flat.  Reluctantly  after being asked by I  E entered the room to find her wireless speaker in the middle of her floor turned off. Now I‚Äôm not gunna lie  it‚Äôs creepy but easy to explain away. But this bitch ass ghost doesn‚Äôt want that.

 I am an exchange student and I ve been staying here for the full year  kinda regretting it since this semester has been hell for me mentally. I ve been isolating myself and now ended up with almost no friends  which results in me not talking to anyone for days or even weeks. I feel like I haven t made the best out of this year since Leeds is full of opportunities and great people  I should be thankful that I had the opportunity to come here in the first place  yet all I do is counting the days till i finally can go back home. I don t know how to make it through exams tbh  all I do is getting myself into fucking k-holes alone in my room because they feel like a big cozy bubble in comparison to this shitshow. Dunno how i ended up posting that on Leedsfess  had to get it out i guess.

I know most of the time when you do good deeds like this you never know how people feel about it  so I just thought I d put this out there and hope that you see it. THANK YOU! You are amazing and wonderful and I hope the karma from this good deed gets you 100% in all of your assessments. thank you thank you thank you <3 <3 <3

If they seem against it;  a friend no longer needed it/never used it so gave it away/ found it sitting outside/ competition prize etc.

 Exam hacks for a final year:  1: Always look up past papers. Lecturers are extremely lazy and recycle questions year after year. Some questions pop up 8-10 years in a row. Guarantee yourself a first by revising topics that consistently pop up.  2: If an MCQ is not negatively marked always put down  false  instead of  don t know  if you re unsure. Most questions are false so you ll get more marks than you lose. Especially if there is only one correct answer.  3: Even if you don t know a question never leave it blank. The mark scheme is highly interpretable. Some of my lecturers have openly said if you rewrite the question in two or three lines of an essay they ll automatically give you 40% as it at least shows that you understand what is being asked even if you are unable to answer it.  You re welcome guys. Try to relax and remain positive xoxo

My family poops big. Maybe it s genetic  maybe it s our diet  but everyone births giant logs of crap. If anyone has laid a mega-poop  you know that sometimes it won t flush. It lays across the hole in the bottom of the bowl and the vortex of draining water merely gives it a spin as it mocks you.  Growing up  this was a common enough occurrence that our family had a poop knife. It was an old rusty kitchen knife that hung on a nail in the laundry room  only to be used for that purpose. It was normal to walk through the hallway and have someone call out  hey  can you get me the poop knife ?  I thought it was standard kit. You have your plunger  your toilet brush  and your poop knife.  Fast forward to 22. It s been a day or two between poops and I m over at my friend s house. My friend was the local dealer and always had  guests  over  because you can t buy weed without sitting on your ass and sampling it for an hour. I excuse myself and lay a gigantic turd. I look down and see that it s a sideways one  so I crack the door and call out for my friend. He arrives and I ask him for his poop knife.   My what?   Your poop knife  I say. I need to use it. Please.   Wtf is a poop knife?   Obviously he has one  but maybe he calls it by a more delicate name. A fecal cleaver? A Dung divider? A guano glaive? I explain what it is I want and why I want it.  He starts giggling. Then laughing. Then lots of people start laughing. It turns out  the music stopped and everyone heard my pleas through the door. It also turns out that none of them had poop knives  it was just my fucked up family with their fucked up bowels. FML.  I told this to my wife last night  who was amused and horrified at the same time. It turns out that she did not know what a poop knife was and had been using the old rusty knife hanging in the utility closet as a basic utility knife. Thankfully she didn t cook with it  but used it to open Amazon boxes.  She will be getting her own utility knife now.  Why was this not in the bathroom instead of the laundry room? We only had one poop knife  and the laundry room was central to all three bathrooms. I have no idea why we didn t have three poop knives. All I know is that we didn t. We had the one. Possibly because my father was notoriously cheap about the weirdest things. So yes  we shared our poop knife.

Never ever isolate a flat mate. Doesn‚Äôt matter what you think of them. They are human. They likely don‚Äôt know a ton of people here because they aren‚Äôt from here. Even if you‚Äôre a selfish twat who can‚Äôt even think about other people‚Äôs emotions  do it for yourself  you don‚Äôt want that guilt if you push them too far. Remember you don‚Äôt know how close anyone is to giving up  the smallest thing could tip them. Be a civilised human being and be nice to people  if you can‚Äôt even do that for your own flatmates you‚Äôre not mature enough to be at uni.

Fun fact: There are more people who are raped than people who lie about rape. There are more people who are raped than people who lie about rape. We shouldn t focus on those who lie when those who don t often do not get the justice they need and deserve. Rape victims are given little to no support  legal help is often inaccessible  people seem to assume that those who are victims are lying and the evidential burden is often disgusting. Rape liars are given a huge amount of media attention  they are rightly discussed and they deserve punishment BUT rape victims aren t given the attention they deserve. There seems to be more discussion about those who lie than those who aren t lying and have had their lives ruined by a horrific act.

Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve seen posts on here saying that individual action against climate change won‚Äôt do anything because the top 100 polluting companies who produce 71% of emissions are really to blame. Companies and governments WON‚ÄôT change if the consumer / political will isn‚Äôt there  so activist movements and increasing consumer awareness are important and will affect positive change! Saying that individual action doesn‚Äôt change anything is like saying you shouldn‚Äôt vote because you‚Äôre just one person. Also  these companies are ran on our money; vote with your money and stop supporting them if you can  instead of just shrugging and saying there‚Äôs nothing you can do as an individual. They don‚Äôt want to lose profit.  Plus  governments and corporations move slowly but there are things you can do to change today; for example  the UK throws away 7 million coffee cups daily even though it would easy and cheap for everyone to switch to reusable cups. We could stop 2.5 BILLION coffee cups being thrown away every year if each individual made the choice to switch to reusables. But  sure  pollution is just the fault of the oil companies.  Get your head out of your arse  have some accountability  and do what you can.
A one night stand asked me to order him an uber home (out of leeds) as his phone died  so to get him out I ordered him one... As he was half way down a motorway I cancelled the uber claiming that somebody else had taken my uber. He got kicked out and I got a refund for the trip. Guess reality didn t match our expectations. I expected an orgasm and he expected to get a free ride home in return for a 5min fuck. Karma.

The wilderness is a harsh and unforgiving place. However  for one individual  this dangerous terrain has taken a great toll: 1 year has passed and the lonely OM is yet to have found a mate.

The next breeding season is fast approaching  will OM be able to find a mate and produce off spring of his own? Only time will tell.

RE: #LeedsFess8507  You only enjoy this situation because you are insecure  and you get off on the idea that more than one person could like you simultaneously. It s not right to your girlfriend to be a cheat  it is never right to cheat. As for the other girl  she literally mugged you off for another geezer... why would you want to revisit that when she clearly doesn t respect you. If you want to be a player then be a man  respectfully break up with your girl and stand on your own to feet. Stop being so pathetically wet about it though.

When are labour supporters going to wake up from their little bubble. Going to univ and say u support labour just because everyone else does is genuinely pathetic...

My little brother‚Äôs got an offer from Leeds for next year so he asked me for a review of the halls. Opinions?  North hill court - genuinely never heard of this  sounds awful  looks really really small  flats of four people? Shit  Lupton - underrated! No ensuite and bit far from uni but cheap and very very social  all the blocks get really close  Oxley - genuinely so far away there is no point going here. Yes the grounds are pretty but that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs in the countryside  Central village - people think they‚Äôre sick because it‚Äôs posh and close to uni and has a Tesco downstairs but not much character and way too expensive. Supposed to be fairly social tbf but others better  Charles Morris - everyone takes the piss because it‚Äôs so fucking expensive. Catered  ensuite  just for people living off daddy‚Äôs money City side - looks okay but over priced? Like central village‚Äôs younger sister. Bit fancy  next to uni and town but not worth the money I reckon  Devonshire Hall - everyone from private schools goes here. Everyone. My mate who went to Cheltenham ladies college went here. Supposed to be decent but do you really want to hang out with a bunch of Tories? Henry price - okay I think? Like fairly average  on campus  but you might as well go to James Baillie  IQ - Next to leodis but further from uni. Apparently okay but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend  James Baillie -  universally acknowledged as the best halls if I‚Äôm being honest. Bit bait  ketty  ‚Äòedgy‚Äô  hosts pres and afters. Realistically where you wanna be but you have to accept you‚Äôre a bit of a twat Leodis - a scam. You know this. Literally everyone applies to leodis because it‚Äôs close to uni and has an ensuite for a decent price. But it‚Äôs so boring. Deadest pres. no one fun goes here because it‚Äôs just people concerned about having the nicest flat. Liberty dock - very very far from uni. Supposedly decent but it‚Äôs not worth it. Everyone forgets about you Lyddon Hall - genuinely know nothing about this? I think like a smaller dev Montague Burton - next to leodis. Nice but bit unknown. Underrated I reckon. Close to uni but fairly sociable  The Tannery - where I spent the whole of first year avoiding leodis lol. Therefore will always have a place in my heart. A lot of medics and dentists because close to the hospital. Far away from everyone Ngl. Pretty sociable  nice community vibes   Anywhere I haven‚Äôt reviewed isn‚Äôt worth mentioning realistically
Re: Leedsfess8377. Sexual assault is something that is extremely traumatic and can have lasting emotional scars. For significant others  this can be very difficult to deal with  as they now have an association of touching with that night. Give her time  be patient. She needs to look after herself and get to a point where she can separate what happened to her from other future sexual encounters. More than ever is she going to need support from those closest to her  to remind her that she is not alone  that she is safe. I know you have to look after yourself and make sure you re getting what you need in the relationship  but she will be so grateful to you for waiting until she is ready  respecting and helping her to be confident in herself again. I really hope that you both are okay  and can work through this together. x
i absolutely love it when a tory equate being a tory with being a minority  as if they have suffered hundreds of years of oppression x

Unpopular opinion again but some of us have worked our a** off to be here. Please don t rob another of their learning experience by tapping away at social media next to someone who s actually trying to concentrate hard during lectures. Either get on our wavelength and appreciate the privilege of this Uni opportunity  or stay home.
Secretly wish I was middle class.

I asked my housemate why he chose to sleep with someone who he described as quite unattractive. This was his answer.  Imagine you love chocolate  but you re only given the chance to eat it once every couple of weeks. That week comes around and you are offered a bounty. Sure  you can wait a couple more weeks and enjoy a twix  or you can eat the bounty  still have chocolate  but not enjoy it as much. What I m trying to say is  that girl is a bounty.
